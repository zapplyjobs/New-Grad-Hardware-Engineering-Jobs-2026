We value pragmatic problem-solving, continuous learning, and modern tooling (including AI-assisted workflows). We build platforms, not one-off solutions—prioritizing consistency, automation, and developer experience. Success means shipping SDKs that power great products in the real world.\n\nWhat We Offer\n• Opportunity to work on industry-leading IoT and smart-home technologies\n• A highly technical team focused on building high-quality, production-ready SDKs\n• Exposure to real customer use cases and shipped products\n• Salary between $100,000 and $140,000 plus a comprehensive benefits package\n• Flexible work arrangements\n• Access to modern development tools and hardware platforms\n\nNote: Applicants must be authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis. We are unable to provide visa sponsorship now or in the future.\n\nReporting Structure\n\nThis role reports to the 802.15.4 Team Lead and works closely with SDK architects, product management, QA, and customer-facing engineering teams.\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace.",

We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. \n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. \n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's Applicant Privacy Notice, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.
