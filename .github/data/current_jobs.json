As a member of the Cloud-Scale Machine Learning Acceleration team you’ll be responsible for the design and optimization of Silicon and Hardware in our data centers including AWS Inferentia, Trainium Systems (our custom designed machine learning inference and training datacenter servers). Our success depends on our world-class server infrastructure; we’re handling massive scale and rapid integration of emergent technologies. We’re looking for an ASIC Physical Design Integration and Verification Engineer to join our backend team. The ideal candidate will be responsible for ensuring the quality and manufacturability of complex semiconductor designs through physical verification processes, and help us trail-blaze new technologies - Its still Day 1 here!\n\nKey job responsibilities\n- Define, execute and optimize next-generation physical verification and integration methodologies using industry-standard EDA tools (Calibre, IC Validator)\n- Drive chip level physical verification sign-off and closure\n- Perform DRC (Design Rule Checking), LVS (Layout vs. Schematic), PERC (Programmable Electrical Rule Check) verification, and Fill insertion\n- Debug and resolve physical verification issues in collaboration with layout and design teams\n- Interface with foundries for rule deck updates and violation waivers\n- Develop and maintain verification runsets and methodologies\n- Support technology file development and qualification\n- Fine tune cloud infrastructure to improve compute and storage utilization for physical design work.\n- Mentor junior engineers on physical verification methodologies and closure\n\nAbout the team\nOur team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge-sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects that help our team members develop your engineering expertise so you feel empowered to take on more complex tasks in the future.\nDiverse Experiences\nAWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply. If your career is just starting, hasn’t followed a traditional path, or includes alternative experiences, don’t let it stop you from applying.\nAbout AWS\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.
