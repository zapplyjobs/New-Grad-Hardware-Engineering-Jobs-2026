    "job_description": "Our mission is to move humanity off of fossil fuel heating. 20% of US global warming emissions come from homes (that's more than cars!). The largest driver of home emissions is burning fossil fuels for heat. To stop climate change, over 80M US homes need to transition from combustion to efficient, electric heat pumps over the coming decades.\n\nWe believe for this to happen the world needs fantastic products that are easy and desirable to purchase. Today's heat pumps lack great design, make limited use of software, and are difficult and stressful to adopt. We are building a next generation, beautifully designed, smart home heating and cooling system that is 10x better than what is on the market today.\nRole\n\nQuilt is hiring a Mechatronics Hardware Engineer to play a key, cross-functional role in both ensuring the quality of our current product line and developing our next-generation products.\nWe are looking for an enthusiastic builder who thrives at the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. The ideal candidate will be passionate about hardware development and writing software to validate hardware and sensor performance.Minimum Qualifications\n• Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Mechatronics, or equivalent experience.\n• Strong hardware prototyping skills. Proven record of projects using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or equivalent.\n• Some experience designing, debugging, and validating embedded systems\n• Some experience writing Python scripts to interface with hardware\n• Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with the ability to develop tests to debug complex issues and propose effective solutions.\n• Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams.\n• Able to self-guide, identify problems and propose & implement solutions, to move towards a shared goal.\n• Passion for electrification and home automation.\n• Strong mission alignment around climate and decarbonization.\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Ability to design simple PCBAs and bring them up\n• Ability and eagerness to move across disciplines jumping into ME, EE, and software where needed\n• Experience with data processing, visualization, and presentation\nResponsibilities\n• Design, build, and run tests to validate product design, including the hardware and software needed\n• Help design tests needed on manufacturing line to ensure hardware built meets product specifications\n• Collaborate with cross-functional teams including product managers, hardware engineers, and data scientists to understand system requirements and translate them into testing specifications\n• Analyze data and present it concisely to inform product design decisions / changes\nCompensation & Benefits\n\nThis is a full-time, onsite position in our Redwood City office with an expected salary range of $100k - $125k, depending on experience. In addition to base salary, Quilt also offers meaningful equity and top-tier health benefits.\n\nRelocation assistance is not available for this role.\n\nDon't meet 100% of the requirements? That's okay, apply anyways! If you're excited about this role and think you could bring something unique to the team, we encourage you to apply—even if your experience doesn't match perfectly. We'd love to hear from you.\n\nAbout Quilt\n\nAt Quilt, we’re on a mission to make clean, efficient heating and cooling accessible to everyone — and we know that heat pumps can play a big role in creating healthier, more climate-resilient homes. But the reality is, climate change and outdated energy systems don’t impact everyone equally. That’s why we’re building a diverse, inclusive team — because we believe the best solutions come from people with different lived experiences and perspectives. We welcome teammates of all races, ethnicities, genders, identities, abilities, and backgrounds, and we’re committed to creating a workplace where everyone feels empowered to shape the future of climate tech.\nNeed accommodations during the hiring process? No problem — just let us know. We’re here to support you. (accessibility@quilt.com)",
