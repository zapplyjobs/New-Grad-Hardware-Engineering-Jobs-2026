Exposure to Core OS, Cloud Infrastructure, Advertising Technology, Platform Portability, Advanced Development, and ML—with opportunities to go deep where you’re strongest.\n• Global collaboration. Partner with experts across the US and internationally (including Cambridge) on cross-functional initiatives.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing\n• Own a scoped project end-to-end: design, implement, test, and ship.\n• Define, agree, and track KPIs that measure technical and business impact.\n• Collaborate effectively across engineering, product, and partner teams to deliver outcomes.\n• Share learnings broadly—write, demo, and document insights to level-up others.\n• Leverage modern tech including innovative AI applications where relevant to your project.\n\nWe're excited if you have\n• Pursuing a MS preferred in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, or a related technical field\n• Previous development internship experience\n• Strong fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, OOD, and systems design.\n• Practical experience in C/C++, Python, Bash, developing/debugging on Linux based embedded systems\n• Understanding of Linux kernel concepts, multi-threading primitives, Linux tools, libraries and open-source development\n• Awareness of or experience with generative AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, OpenAI API) for enhancing development productivity.\n• Familiarity with one or more machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Tensorflow Lite, TensorflowMicro, PyTorch, or scikit-learn through coursework or personal projects.\n• Exposure to Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), Machine Learning, SDK/API design, and integration testing.\n• Comfort with Agile and collaborative tools (JIRA, Confluence, GitHub).\n• A builder’s mindset—creative, resilient, and proactive with a bias to ship.\n• Demonstrated “real world” impact: shipped projects, prior internships, notable contributions (e.g., opensource, publications).\n\nProgram details\n• Duration: 12 weeks, Summer 2026\n• Locations: Boston, San Jose, New York, Austin (on-site expectations vary by team)\n• Project matching: Based on your skills, interests, and team needs—clearly defined, challenging to complete, and easy to start.\n• Career visibility: Understand what full-time life at Roku looks like through mentorship, collaboration, and showcasing your outcomes to engineering leaders and peers.\n\nHow to apply\n• Submit your resume and a brief note on the impact you want to make this summer. Include links to GitHub, portfolio, publications, or notable projects.\n• Highlight the systems you’ve built, the decisions you owned, and the measurable outcomes you drove.\n\nReady to build at streaming scale? Let’s talk.\n\nOur Hybrid Work Approach\n\nRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy.\n\nBenefits\n\nRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.\n\nAccommodations\n\nRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com.\n\nThe Roku Culture\n\nRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. \n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. \n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's Applicant Privacy Notice, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.
