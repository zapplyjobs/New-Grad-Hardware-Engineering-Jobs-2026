Look no further. We're seeking a Senior Analog IC Design Engineer or an Analog IC Design Engineer who thrives on developing innovative solutions. At Mitutoyo Research & Development America, Inc. (MRDA), you'll be creating cutting-edge analog CMOS ASICs. Collaborating with a diverse team of IC designers and scientists, you'll tackle challenging product requirements using clever circuit design techniques.\n\nYou’ll also enjoy the flexibility of our hybrid work model. At MRDA, we prioritize your well-being and work-life balance.\n\nClick here for the detailed job description: https://www.mitutoyo-rda.com/s/2026-03-JD-Analog-IC-Design-Engineer.pdf\n\nTHE COOL THINGS YOU WILL BE DOING WITH YOUR TALENTS\n\nAs a talented Analog IC Design Engineer, you'll have the opportunity to work on exciting projects. You'll be designing, simulating, laying out, and testing Analog and Mixed Signal ICs that interface with imaging sensors, and capacitive and inductive transducers. Some of the circuits you and your team will be designing: signal conditioning, sensor excitation, analog-digital conversion (ADC, DAC), system on a chip (SoC), power management circuits.\n\nYou will also be working with scientists on the definition and system design of the next generation of metrology products.\n\nBut that's not all - you'll also have the chance to research and investigate new and innovative technologies, industry trends, and techniques to improve our products. This means you'll be at the forefront of innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and driving our products forward.\n\nOccasional travel to Japan will offer you an opportunity to experience a different culture and learn from it.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO SUCCEED\n\nTo thrive in this role, you'll need an intuitive and analytical understanding of analog CMOS circuit design. Proficiency with EDA design tools is also essential. A successful track record of designing and debugging low power CMOS analog ICs is a must-have.\n\nIf you’re a Senior Analog IC Design Engineer with 12+ years of industry experience and architecture planning, system level design and modeling skills, this is the perfect fit. If you’re an Analog IC Design Engineer with 3+ years of industry experience and are eager to grow into a senior role, we also want to hear from you.\n\nGreat written and oral communication skills are also crucial, including the ability to clearly explain technology and document design concepts in detail. Finally, a willingness to learn new skills, work effectively independently or in a cross-functional team, and collaborate with diverse cultures and attitudes is essential for success in this role.\n\nAt MRDA, we value not just what you bring to the table today, but also your potential to shape tomorrow's innovations.\n\nFor a list of required and beneficial skills and experience, see the job description at https://www.mitutoyo-rda.com/2026-03.\n\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nThe salary range is $120,000-$180,000 per year for the Senior Analog IC Design Engineer and $100,000-$140,000 per year for the Analog IC Design Engineer.

You will perform mechanical design of the Affordable Long-range Persistent Surveillance-Mobile product. You will use Solidworks CAD software and Windchill PLM software daily to turn ideas into designs. Then you’ll work alongside the production team to turn your designs into hardware. You might be asked to help integrate and install the hardware, and then you’ll work with the testing team to put your hardware into action. This is not your average engineering position. You will work on a team of the most talented engineers in the region who push you to be better every day. This is a fast-paced program with unique technical challenges that will be a rewarding milestone in any engineering career. If you are up for the challenge of joining this team, then apply today to be considered.\n\nAre you ready to make an impact? Share your resume with us today!\n\nTHE CHALLENGE (primary responsibilities)\n• Structural design via Solidworks CAD software, drawing generation in accordance with ASME Y14.100 & Y14.5, and producing technical data packages in accordance with MIL-STD-31000\n\nWHAT SETS YOU APART (basic qualifications)\n• Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering or Aerospace Engineering from an ABET-accredited university\n• 4+ years of applicable experience or 2+ years with MS degree.\n• Strong SolidWorks user\n• Active secret security clearance or ability to obtain and maintain secret security clearance\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Windchill PLM experience\n• Design and/or Integration experience in the following areas:\n\nPower generation\n• Tactical shelter design\n• Telecommunication towers\n• Mobile tactical equipment\n• Tactical trailers\n\nIf you're looking for comfort, keep scrolling. At Leidos, we outthink, outbuild, and outpace the status quo — because the mission demands it. We're not hiring followers. We're recruiting the ones who disrupt, provoke, and refuse to fail. Step 10 is ancient history. We're already at step 30 — and moving faster than anyone else dares.\n\nOriginal Posting:\nFebruary 13, 2026\n\nFor U.S. Positions: While subject to change based on business needs, Leidos reasonably anticipates that this job requisition will remain open for at least 3 days with an anticipated close date of no earlier than 3 days after the original posting date as listed above.\n\nPay Range:\nPay Range $87,100.00 - $157,450.00\n\nThe Leidos pay range for this job level is a general guideline only and not a guarantee of compensation or salary. Additional factors considered in extending an offer include (but are not limited to) responsibilities of the job, education, experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity, alignment with market data, applicable bargaining agreement (if any), or other law.\n\nAbout Leidos\n\nLeidos is an industry and technology leader serving government and commercial customers with smarter, more efficient digital and mission innovations. Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, with 47,000 global employees, Leidos reported annual revenues of approximately $16.7 billion for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2025. For more information, visit www.Leidos.com.\n\nPay and Benefits\n\nPay and benefits are fundamental to any career decision. That's why we craft compensation packages that reflect the importance of the work we do for our customers. Employment benefits include competitive compensation, Health and Wellness programs, Income Protection, Paid Leave and Retirement. More details are available at www.leidos.com/careers/pay-benefits.\n\nSecuring Your Data\n\nBeware of fake employment opportunities using Leidos’ name. Leidos will never ask you to provide payment-related information during any part of the employment application process (i.e., ask you for money), nor will Leidos ever advance money as part of the hiring process (i.e., send you a check or money order before doing any work). Further, Leidos will only communicate with you through emails that are generated by the Leidos.com automated system – never from free commercial services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail) or via WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. If you received an email purporting to be from Leidos that asks for payment-related information or any other personal information (e.g., about you or your previous employer), and you are concerned about its legitimacy, please make us aware immediately by emailing us at LeidosCareersFraud@leidos.com.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of a scam, contact your local law enforcement and report the incident to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nCommitment to Non-Discrimination\n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, ethnicity, age, national origin, citizenship, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, pregnancy, family structure, marital status, ancestry, domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran or military status, or any other basis prohibited by law.
