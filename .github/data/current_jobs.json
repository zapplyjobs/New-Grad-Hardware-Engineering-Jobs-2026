    "job_description": "Senior Analog IC Design Engineer or Analog IC Design Engineer\n\nKirkland, Washington - Full Time\n\nLooking for a dynamic role where you can leverage your expertise in analog IC design? Look no further. We're seeking a Senior Analog IC Design Engineer or an Analog IC Design Engineer who thrives on developing innovative solutions. At Mitutoyo Research & Development America, Inc. (MRDA), you'll be creating cutting-edge analog CMOS ASICs. Collaborating with a diverse team of IC designers and scientists, you'll tackle challenging product requirements using clever circuit design techniques.\n\nYou’ll also enjoy the flexibility of our hybrid work model. At MRDA, we prioritize your well-being and work-life balance.\n\nClick here for the detailed job description: https://www.mitutoyo-rda.com/s/2026-03-JD-Analog-IC-Design-Engineer.pdf\n\nTHE COOL THINGS YOU WILL BE DOING WITH YOUR TALENTS\n\nAs a talented Analog IC Design Engineer, you'll have the opportunity to work on exciting projects. You'll be designing, simulating, laying out, and testing Analog and Mixed Signal ICs that interface with imaging sensors, and capacitive and inductive transducers. Some of the circuits you and your team will be designing: signal conditioning, sensor excitation, analog-digital conversion (ADC, DAC), system on a chip (SoC), power management circuits.\n\nYou will also be working with scientists on the definition and system design of the next generation of metrology products.\n\nBut that's not all - you'll also have the chance to research and investigate new and innovative technologies, industry trends, and techniques to improve our products. This means you'll be at the forefront of innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and driving our products forward.\n\nOccasional travel to Japan will offer you an opportunity to experience a different culture and learn from it.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO SUCCEED\n\nTo thrive in this role, you'll need an intuitive and analytical understanding of analog CMOS circuit design. Proficiency with EDA design tools is also essential. A successful track record of designing and debugging low power CMOS analog ICs is a must-have.\n\nIf you’re a Senior Analog IC Design Engineer with 12+ years of industry experience and architecture planning, system level design and modeling skills, this is the perfect fit. If you’re an Analog IC Design Engineer with 3+ years of industry experience and are eager to grow into a senior role, we also want to hear from you.\n\nGreat written and oral communication skills are also crucial, including the ability to clearly explain technology and document design concepts in detail. Finally, a willingness to learn new skills, work effectively independently or in a cross-functional team, and collaborate with diverse cultures and attitudes is essential for success in this role.\n\nAt MRDA, we value not just what you bring to the table today, but also your potential to shape tomorrow's innovations.\n\nFor a list of required and beneficial skills and experience, see the job description at https://www.mitutoyo-rda.com/2026-03.\n\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nThe salary range is $120,000-$180,000 per year for the Senior Analog IC Design Engineer and $100,000-$140,000 per year for the Analog IC Design Engineer.
