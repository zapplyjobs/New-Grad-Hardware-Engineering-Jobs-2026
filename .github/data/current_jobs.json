    "job_description": "Senior Analog IC Design Engineer or Analog IC Design Engineer\n\nKirkland, Washington - Full Time\n\nLooking for a dynamic role where you can leverage your expertise in analog IC design? Look no further. We're seeking a Senior Analog IC Design Engineer or an Analog IC Design Engineer who thrives on developing innovative solutions. At Mitutoyo Research & Development America, Inc. (MRDA), you'll be creating cutting-edge analog CMOS ASICs. Collaborating with a diverse team of IC designers and scientists, you'll tackle challenging product requirements using clever circuit design techniques.\n\nYou’ll also enjoy the flexibility of our hybrid work model. At MRDA, we prioritize your well-being and work-life balance.\n\nClick here for the detailed job description: https://www.mitutoyo-rda.com/s/2026-03-JD-Analog-IC-Design-Engineer.pdf\n\nTHE COOL THINGS YOU WILL BE DOING WITH YOUR TALENTS\n\nAs a talented Analog IC Design Engineer, you'll have the opportunity to work on exciting projects. You'll be designing, simulating, laying out, and testing Analog and Mixed Signal ICs that interface with imaging sensors, and capacitive and inductive transducers. Some of the circuits you and your team will be designing: signal conditioning, sensor excitation, analog-digital conversion (ADC, DAC), system on a chip (SoC), power management circuits.\n\nYou will also be working with scientists on the definition and system design of the next generation of metrology products.\n\nBut that's not all - you'll also have the chance to research and investigate new and innovative technologies, industry trends, and techniques to improve our products.
