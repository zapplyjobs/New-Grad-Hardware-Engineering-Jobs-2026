You understand both hard- and soft-switched topologies.\n\nResponsibilities include:\n\nYou can create highly accurate time-domain control and thermal models of your circuits to inform software and mechanical development, and while your core specialty is high-power circuitry design, you have a working understanding of microprocessor selection, electrical insulation, and thermal interface. Knowing how important circuit board layout is in high-power conversion, you're willing to jump in and do the most critical parts of the powertrain layout yourself.\n\nThe ideal candidate is highly self-driven, adaptable to a startup environment, and eager to take on technical challenges. You're a doer, excited about working in a dynamic, fast-paced setting, and want to shape the electrical engineering function within a new department at Redwood.\n\nIf necessary, we will adjust the job level to suit your experience and responsibilities. The qualifications below are just that - desired - if you feel you're highly qualified for this role but are missing a few of the below line items, we encourage you to apply anyway.\n\nDesired Qualifications:\n• BS, MS, or PhD in Electrical Engineering, with a focus in power electronics\n• 7+ years of experience in electrical engineering, with a strong focus in power conversion or energy storage products, ideally for mass production\n• Experience in high-voltage (up to 2000VDC, and 480VAC) design\n• Intimately familiar with techniques for efficiency optimization\n• Basic knowledge of control theory and embedded systems\n• Strong analytical / problem solving skills\n• Experience in rapid iterations on prototypes based on customer, supplier, and co-worker feedback\n• Strong understanding of power electronics topologies and fundamentals (AC/DC, DC/DC)\n• Experience with semiconductor selections, gate drive, and protection circuit design\n• Skilled in mentoring test technicians to design tests, interpret test results, and define part maturity criteria\n• Skilled at working with basic EE tools like oscilloscopes, network analyzers, signal Generators, etc\n• Proven track record as a electrical engineer, with hands-on design, prototyping, and launch experience in medium-to-high volume production (10,000 units/yr or higher)\n• Able to select circuit components for manufacturability as well as electrical function\n• Able to perform detailed schematic capture in Altium or related CAD software\n• Able to supervise (and occasionally perform) detailed layout of high-power electronics PCBs in Altium or related CAD software\n\nPhysical Requirements:\n• Ability to perform the essential job functions consistent safely and successfully with the ADA, FMLA and other federal, state and local standards, including meeting qualitative and/or quantitative productivity standards\n• Ability to maintain regular, punctual attendance consistent with the ADA, FMLA and other federal, state, and local standards\n\nWorking Conditions:\n• Environment, such as office or outdoors\n• Ability to work in challenging working conditions which may include exposure to noise, dust, chemicals, and temperature extremes, while protected by PPE, for extended periods of time\n• Essential physical requirements, such as climbing, standing, stooping, or typing\n• Occasional work weekends, nights, or be on-call as a regular part of the job\n• Occasional travel requirements\n\nIn accordance with California pay transparency laws, the salary range for this position is listed below. Actual compensation may vary based on a variety of factors, including experience, education, and skills.\n\nCalifornia Pay Range:\n\n$145,500-$196,500 USD\n\nThe position is full-time. Compensation will be commensurate with experience.\n\nWe collect personal information (PI) from you in connection with your application for employment with Redwood Materials, including the following categories of PI: identifiers, personal records, professional or employment information, and inferences drawn from your PI. We collect your PI for our purposes, including performing services and operations related to your potential employment.

We’ll build the tools ourselves so we can quickly iterate and improve.\n\nWe’re building a small team of exceptional, hands-on engineers to make this happen. Mechanical, electrical, hardware, computer, and process. We’ll own the stack from atoms to architecture. Our team is optimistic about the future and we want to continue pushing the limits of technology.\n\nSmaller is better. Faster is better. Building it ourselves is better.\n\nWe believe our team and lab can build anything. We’ve set up 3D printers, a wide array of microscopes, e-beam writers, general fabrication equipment - and whatever is missing, we’ll just invent along the way.\n\nAtomic was founded by Sam Zeloof and Jim Keller. Sam is best known for making chips in his garage, and Jim has been a leader in the semiconductor industry for the past 40 years.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWe are looking for an enthusiastic power electronics engineer who can rapidly develop compact RF systems from gathering requirements to the production stage. You will get to own entire RF power systems while working closely with other engineers to enable small and fast semiconductor plasma systems.

The ideal candidate is self driven and proactive in figuring out the necessary tasks to complete. A portfolio of previous work is required for this application. Show us what you have built!\n\nResponsibilities\n• Designing complete RF power systems from architecture to schematic to layout\n• Ensure accurate RF power diagnostics and metrology\n• Collaborate with engineers and scientists to gather system requirements\n• Designing and building very high frequency power supplies\n• Integrate RF power systems to plasma tools and testing. You will run etches and depositions to verify performance\n\nRequired Experience\n• Complete end to end ownership of RF systems\n• RF resonant power amplifier design in the 100s of Watts range\n• RF power measurement sensor design\n• Hands on prototyping and testing\n\nNice-to-have\n• Advanced degree in power electronics or related field\n• Plasma systems experience\n• Systems engineering and integration\n• HV systems experience\n\nWorking at Atomic Semi\n\nWe’re an early-stage hardware startup with solid funding, world-class advisors, and a lab/office in San Francisco, CA.\n\nCompensation: Atomic Semi is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices. The annual salary range for this role is $120,000 – $160,000. Compensation is determined based on your qualifications and experience. Our total compensation package also includes generous equity in Atomic Semi.\n\nBenefits: Atomic Semi offers the following benefits, subject to applicable eligibility requirements:\n• Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance\n• Generous Paid Time Off inclusive of Holidays and Sick Time\n• Visa Sponsorship\n• Life and Disability Insurance\n• Paid Parental Leave\n• 401(k) retirement plan\n• Weekly Learning & Development opportunities\n• Commuter Benefits including Parking and Late Night Uber rides from the office\n• Lunches daily, Dinners 3x per week, Stocked Office Kitchen with Snacks and Spindrifts\n\nWe are an equal-opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability or other legally protected statuses.\n\nExport Control Analysis: This position involves access to technology that is subject to U.S. export controls.
