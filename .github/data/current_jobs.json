    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril’s Tactical Recon &amp;amp; Strike (TRS) is a division with two missions: 1) build highly capable autonomous drones, and 2) build solid rocket motors at scale. We transform products like Ghost, Anvil, Bolt, and Altius from early concepts into fully operational capabilities by partnering closely with specialist engineering, operations, and production teams. Through our Anduril Rocket Motor Systems (RMS) team, we design and manufacture solid rocket motors using advanced materials, proprietary formulations, and high-volume production methods—delivering safe, reliable propulsion systems that support a wide range of mission requirements. TRS hires software engineers &amp;amp; hardware engineers, who are excited to build across a diverse and powerful portfolio—from autonomous aerial systems to high-performance solid rocket motors. Our teams contribute to highly capable autonomous robotics systems and propulsion products that operate reliably in the most demanding mission environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mechanical engineer position is responsible for the physical design of Anduril Atlanta unmanned aircraft and related hardware systems.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anduril’s Tactical Recon &amp;amp; Strike (TRS) is a division with two missions: 1) build highly capable autonomous drones, and 2) build solid rocket motors at scale. We transform products like Ghost, Anvil, Bolt, and Altius from early concepts into fully operational capabilities by partnering closely with specialist engineering, operations, and production teams.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;Anduril’s Tactical Recon &amp;amp; Strike (TRS) is a division with two missions: 1) build highly capable autonomous drones, and 2) build solid rocket motors at scale. We transform products like Ghost, Anvil, Bolt, and Altius from early concepts into fully operational capabilities by partnering closely with specialist engineering, operations, and production teams. Through our Anduril Rocket Motor Systems (RMS) team, we design and manufacture solid rocket motors using advanced materials, proprietary formulations, and high-volume production methods—delivering safe, reliable propulsion systems that support a wide range of mission requirements. TRS hires software engineers &amp;amp; hardware engineers, who are excited to build across a diverse and powerful portfolio—from autonomous aerial systems to high-performance solid rocket motors. Our teams contribute to highly capable autonomous robotics systems and propulsion products that operate reliably in the most demanding mission environment.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;Anduril is seeking a Mechanical Engineer to join the team at our Costa Mesa HQ.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril is seeking a Mechanical Engineer to join the Omen team at our Costa Mesa HQ.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril is seeking a Mechanical Engineer to join the Omen team at our Costa Mesa HQ.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Air Defense team builds robots that find other robots and knock them out of the sky. At a time when air superiority can no longer be taken for granted, the Air Defense Team provides mission critical capabilities to warfighters. From detection to tracking, identification, deterrence, and defeat, our family of networked sensors and effectors enables our customers to rapidly close the kill chain against a broad range of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) threats. Working across product, engineering, sales, logistics, operations, and mission success, the Air Defense team develops, tests, deploys, and sustains the Anduril Air Defense Family of Systems (FoS) in challenging operational environments worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE ROLE&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking for a Staff Software Engineer specializing in Robotics to join our growing team in Irvine, CA.
