Founded in 2017, we're delivering low-cost and large-scale energy storage and producing battery materials in the U.S. for the first time, all from batteries we already have.\n\nPower Electronics Engineer, Energy Storage\n\nEssential Duties:\n\nYou will be an early member of a product design team, responsible for the detailed power electronics design, prototype, and launch into high-volume production of an efficient, cost effective, highly manufacturable, and technologically leading-edge power converter.\n\nFamiliar with high voltage (up to ~1,000 - 2,000VDC and 480VAC) and high power (~10 - 200kW) power converters, you can quantitatively compare and select topologies, control algorithms, semiconductors, and magnetics while respecting engineering constraints (efficiency, cost, reliability, simplicity, etc). You understand both hard- and soft-switched topologies.\n\nResponsibilities include:\n\nYou can create highly accurate time-domain control and thermal models of your circuits to inform software and mechanical development, and while your core specialty is high-power circuitry design, you have a working understanding of microprocessor selection, electrical insulation, and thermal interface. Knowing how important circuit board layout is in high-power conversion, you're willing to jump in and do the most critical parts of the powertrain layout yourself.\n\nThe ideal candidate is highly self-driven, adaptable to a startup environment, and eager to take on technical challenges. You're a doer, excited about working in a dynamic, fast-paced setting, and want to shape the electrical engineering function within a new department at Redwood.\n\nIf necessary, we will adjust the job level to suit your experience and responsibilities. The qualifications below are just that - desired - if you feel you're highly qualified for this role but are missing a few of the below line items, we encourage you to apply anyway.\n\nDesired Qualifications:\n• BS, MS, or PhD in Electrical Engineering, with a focus in power electronics\n• 7+ years of experience in electrical engineering, with a strong focus in power conversion or energy storage products, ideally for mass production\n• Experience in high-voltage (up to 2000VDC, and 480VAC) design\n• Intimately familiar with techniques for efficiency optimization\n• Basic knowledge of control theory and embedded systems\n• Strong analytical / problem solving skills\n• Experience in rapid iterations on prototypes based on customer, supplier, and co-worker feedback\n• Strong understanding of power electronics topologies and fundamentals (AC/DC, DC/DC)\n• Experience with semiconductor selections, gate drive, and protection circuit design\n• Skilled in mentoring test technicians to design tests, interpret test results, and define part maturity criteria\n• Skilled at working with basic EE tools like oscilloscopes, network analyzers, signal Generators, etc\n• Proven track record as a electrical engineer, with hands-on design, prototyping, and launch experience in medium-to-high volume production (10,000 units/yr or higher)\n• Able to select circuit components for manufacturability as well as electrical function\n• Able to perform detailed schematic capture in Altium or related CAD software\n• Able to supervise (and occasionally perform) detailed layout of high-power electronics PCBs in Altium or related CAD software\n\nPhysical Requirements:\n• Ability to perform the essential job functions consistent safely and successfully with the ADA, FMLA and other federal, state and local standards, including meeting qualitative and/or quantitative productivity standards\n• Ability to maintain regular, punctual attendance consistent with the ADA, FMLA and other federal, state, and local standards\n\nWorking Conditions:\n• Environment, such as office or outdoors\n• Ability to work in challenging working conditions which may include exposure to noise, dust, chemicals, and temperature extremes, while protected by PPE, for extended periods of time\n• Essential physical requirements, such as climbing, standing, stooping, or typing\n• Occasional work weekends, nights, or be on-call as a regular part of the job\n• Occasional travel requirements\n\nIn accordance with California pay transparency laws, the salary range for this position is listed below. Actual compensation may vary based on a variety of factors, including experience, education, and skills.\n\nCalifornia Pay Range:\n\n$145,500-$196,500 USD\n\nThe position is full-time. Compensation will be commensurate with experience.\n\nWe collect personal information (PI) from you in connection with your application for employment with Redwood Materials, including the following categories of PI: identifiers, personal records, professional or employment information, and inferences drawn from your PI.
