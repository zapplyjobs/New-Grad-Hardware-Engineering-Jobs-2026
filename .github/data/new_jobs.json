The hardware footprint is big – we build ultra-low power sensors, ruggedized asset trackers, vehicle ADAS systems with AI/ML, telematics systems, and rackmount video inspection with AI/Ml, with more to come in the future. We leverage myriad technologies including low-power MCUs, big SoCs, DSPs, LTE, GPS, BLE, WiFi, imaging sensors, ML/AI/CV, accelerometers, and more.&amp;nbsp; Our challenges span the gamut from eeking out single-digit microamps to thermals to desense to cost reduction to antenna design to enclosure design that survives extreme environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for an Electrical Engineer co-op to join our team. In the day-to-day, you will be responsible for working on the EE aspects of the design of products based on thorough feasibility, design, and cost studies encompassing key component selection, thermals, antenna, etc. We have a tremendous amount of telemetry and access to customers that help guide our design process. You will work directly with our customers to ensure we lead the industry with our product design. We run a collaborative process working closely with Product Management, PD, FW, EPM, NPI, and Hardware leadership to make excellent tradeoffs and choices. Throughout this process, you’ll share your expertise with other engineers. The US and Taiwan EE teams are supported by the Supply Chain team, laboratories, JDM design resources, and a growing supply base.
